## overview
* If there is no implementation but there is only declaration(requirement specification) of method then we use interface. Method is declared but the implementation is not performed.
  * ex: servlets
* When we have partial implementation of method then we use abstract class.
 * Generic servlets and https servlets
* When we have complete implementation and can provide service then we use concrete class(normal java class).
 * ex: own servlets
