## Overview 
* Following best practices to avoid code smell(bad code) we use design patterns.
* Simply knowing a programming language and its constructs will not make you a better programmer or developer. It requires knowledge of Design Patterns to create software that will work today and also in future.
* Each Design Pattern is for solving a particular kind of situation; there might be situations where more than one Design Pattern can be used.


## Principles of design pattern/object oriented design patterns
1) Prefer composition over Inheritance
2) Code for interface not for Implememtation

## Types of design patterns
* 1) Creational --> If the requirement is to create an object, to get that object we use creational design pattern. **Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype**
* 2) Structural --> If we want to compose an object(have one object and want to include other into existing object or one object using other object properties) then we use structural design pattern. **Adapter, Composite, Proxy, Fly weight, Facade, Bridge, Decorator**
* 3) Behavioural --> If we have 2 objects but don't want to compose them but we want to make communication between that 2 objects then we use behavioural design pattern. **Template method, Mediator, Chain of responsibility, Observe, Strategy, command, state, visitor, Iterator, Interpreter, Memento**
