## Overview
* Java converts the basic instructions to the **ByteCode (0,1)**(which is common irrespective of operating system)
* conversion bytecode to windows Instructions is through(windows JVM --> piece of software) because windows instructions can only understand normal language (or) instructions specific to that OS.
* ex: windows instructions, linux instructions.
* we get bytecode when Java code is compiled to run the program on the specific operating system which is called as **Execution**.
* During Execution, we use JVM to convert Bytecode to windows specific instructions.
* **JVM(Java Virtual Machine)** --> runs java byteCode.
* **JRE(Java Runtime Environment)** --> JVM+libraries+other components. Application users use JRE (user who uses developed app--using a website)
* **JDK(Java Development Kit)** --> JVM+Compilers+Debuggers. Application Developers use JDK
